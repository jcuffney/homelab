# Task 1.12: Add DNS Overrides for VMs (As Needed)

**Objective**: Add DNS entries for your VMs as you create them using FQDNs.

**Steps**:
1. Determine VM IP address (from Proxmox UI or DHCP leases)
2. Choose a Middle Earth name for the VM (see `.cursorrules` for naming convention)
3. In OPNsense: **Services → Unbound DNS → Overrides**
4. Click **Add** button
5. Configure:
   - **Host**: `vm-name` (e.g., `rivendell`, `gondor`, etc. - use Middle Earth naming)
   - **Domain**: `cuffney.com`
   - **Type**: `A`
   - **Value**: `192.168.1.X` (VM's IP address)
   - **Description**: `VM Description` (e.g., `Ubuntu VM`)
6. Click **Save**
7. Click **Apply Changes**

8. (Optional) Add Route 53 record for external/VPN access:
   - In AWS Route 53, create A record: `vm-name.cuffney.com` → `192.168.1.X`

**Test**:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution (both short and FQDN)
nslookup vm-name
# Should resolve to VM's IP

nslookup vm-name.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to VM's IP

# Test SSH access using FQDN
ssh jcuffney@vm-name.cuffney.com
# Should connect to VM
```

**Expected Result**: VM FQDN resolves and SSH works using `ssh jcuffney@vm-name.cuffney.com`.
