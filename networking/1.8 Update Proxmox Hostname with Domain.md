# Task 1.8: Update Proxmox Hostname with Domain

**Objective**: Set FQDN hostname on Proxmox.

## Why This Is Needed

Setting the FQDN hostname on Proxmox provides several benefits:

1. **System Identification**: The system identifies itself with the full domain name, making it clear which system you're working with
2. **SSL/TLS Certificates**: If you use SSL certificates (Task 3.x), they need to match the hostname - FQDN makes this easier
3. **Service Discovery**: Some services and applications use the system hostname for identification and logging
4. **Consistency**: Matches your DNS configuration and network naming scheme
5. **Logging**: System logs will show `numenor.cuffney.com` instead of just `numenor`, making logs clearer
6. **Best Practice**: Using FQDNs is a networking best practice for professional setups

**Note**: DNS resolution will work regardless of the system hostname (thanks to DNS overrides), but setting the FQDN ensures the system itself knows its full identity.

**Steps**:
1. SSH into Proxmox: `ssh root@192.168.1.10`
2. Set hostname with domain:
   ```bash
   hostnamectl set-hostname numenor.cuffney.com
   ```
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   hostnamectl
   # Should show: Static hostname: numenor.cuffney.com
   ```

**Test**:
```bash
# Verify hostname
hostname
# Should output: numenor.cuffney.com

hostname -f
# Should output: numenor.cuffney.com
```

**Expected Result**: Proxmox hostname is set to `numenor.cuffney.com`.
