# Task 1.7: Configure Route 53 DNS Records

**Objective**: Create DNS records in AWS Route 53 for internal hosts (both themed and descriptive names).

**Steps**:
1. Access AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
2. Navigate to your `cuffney.com` hosted zone
3. Create the following A records (for external/VPN access - internal network will use Unbound overrides):
   
   **OPNsense records** (both themed and descriptive):
   - **Name**: `shire.cuffney.com`
     - **Type**: A
     - **Value**: Your public IP address
     - **TTL**: 300
   - **Name**: `opnsense.cuffney.com`
     - **Type**: A
     - **Value**: Your public IP address
     - **TTL**: 300
   
   **Proxmox records** (both themed and descriptive):
   - **Name**: `numenor.cuffney.com`
     - **Type**: A
     - **Value**: Your public IP address
     - **TTL**: 300
   - **Name**: `proxmox.cuffney.com`
     - **Type**: A
     - **Value**: Your public IP address
     - **TTL**: 300
4. **Note**: These Route 53 records are primarily for external/VPN access. Internal network will use Unbound overrides (Task 1.9-1.10) which point to private IPs.

**Test**:
```bash
# From external network (not on your LAN):
nslookup shire.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to your public IP

nslookup opnsense.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to your public IP

nslookup numenor.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to your public IP

nslookup proxmox.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to your public IP
```

**Expected Result**: Route 53 records exist for both themed and descriptive hostnames.
