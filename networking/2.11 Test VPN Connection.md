# Task 2.11: Test VPN Connection

**Objective**: Verify VPN connection works and can access LAN services using FQDNs.

**Steps**:
1. Connect to WireGuard VPN on your device
2. Verify connection status shows "Connected"

**Test**:
```bash
# From VPN-connected device:

# Test basic connectivity
ping 192.168.1.1      # OPNsense - should work
ping 192.168.1.10     # Proxmox - should work
ping 10.10.0.1        # VPN gateway - should work

# Test DNS resolution (short names)
nslookup numenor
# Should resolve to 192.168.1.10

nslookup shire
# Should resolve to 192.168.1.1

# Test DNS resolution (FQDNs)
nslookup numenor.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to 192.168.1.10

nslookup shire.cuffney.com
# Should resolve to 192.168.1.1

# Test SSH access using FQDNs
ssh jcuffney@numenor.cuffney.com
# Should connect to Proxmox

ssh jcuffney@shire.cuffney.com
# Should connect to OPNsense (if SSH enabled)

# Test service access
curl https://numenor.cuffney.com:8006
# Should access Proxmox Web UI
```

**Expected Result**: VPN connection works and can access all LAN services using FQDNs.
