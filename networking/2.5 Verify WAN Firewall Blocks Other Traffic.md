# Task 2.5: Verify WAN Firewall Blocks Other Traffic

**Objective**: Ensure no other services are accessible from internet.

**Steps**:
1. In OPNsense: **Firewall → Rules → WAN**
2. Review existing rules
3. Verify:
   - Only WireGuard (UDP 51820) rule allows traffic
   - Default deny rule exists (should be automatic)
   - No rules allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), or other services

**Test**:
```bash
# From a device NOT on your network (mobile data):
# These should ALL fail:
curl http://your-public-ip:80      # Should timeout/fail
curl http://your-public-ip:443    # Should timeout/fail
curl http://your-public-ip:8006    # Should timeout/fail
```

**Expected Result**: Only WireGuard port is accessible from internet.
