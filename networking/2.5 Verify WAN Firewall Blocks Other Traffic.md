# Task 2.5: Verify WAN Firewall Blocks Other Traffic

**Objective**: Ensure no other services are accessible from internet.

**Steps**:
1. In OPNsense: **Firewall → Rules → WAN**
2. Review existing rules and verify:
   - **WireGuard rule exists**: Should see a rule allowing UDP port 51820
   - **Only WireGuard allows traffic**: No other rules allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), or other services from internet
   - **Block rules exist**: Should see rules blocking:
     - Bogons (invalid IP ranges)
     - Private networks (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, etc.)
   - **Default deny exists**: Should see "Default deny / state violation rule" (system rule)
3. **Optional - Optimize rule order**:
   - WireGuard rule should ideally be before block/deny rules
   - If it's at the bottom, it should still work, but you can move it higher
   - To reorder: Click the rule, use up/down arrows to move it
   - **Ideal position**: After system rules (DHCP, IPv6) but before block rules

**Test**:
```bash
# From a device NOT on your network (mobile data):
# These should ALL fail:
curl http://your-public-ip:80      # Should timeout/fail
curl http://your-public-ip:443    # Should timeout/fail
curl http://your-public-ip:8006    # Should timeout/fail
```

**Expected Result**: Only WireGuard port is accessible from internet.
