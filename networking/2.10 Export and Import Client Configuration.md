# Task 2.10: Export and Import Client Configuration

**Objective**: Get WireGuard config file for your device.

**Steps**:
1. In OPNsense: **VPN → WireGuard → Local**
2. Click on the client you created (Task 2.9)
3. Click **Show QR Code** or **Download Config**
4. If downloading:
   - Save the `.conf` file
   - Edit the file and ensure it includes:
     ```
     [Interface]
     ...
     DNS = 192.168.1.1
     ```
   - If DNS is missing, add it manually
   - **Note**: DNS server `192.168.1.1` (shire) will resolve `*.cuffney.com` domains via Unbound
5. Import into WireGuard client on your device:
   - **iOS/Android**: Scan QR code or import config file
   - **Windows/Mac/Linux**: Import config file into WireGuard app

**Test**:
```bash
# After importing, connect to VPN
# Verify connection status in WireGuard app
```

**Expected Result**: WireGuard config is imported and ready to connect.
