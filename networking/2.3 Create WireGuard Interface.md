# Task 2.3: Create WireGuard Interface

**Objective**: Create network interface for WireGuard VPN.

**Steps**:
1. In OPNsense: **Interfaces → Assignments**
2. Click **Add** button (or find WireGuard interface)
3. Select **WireGuard** as interface type
4. Configure:
   - **Interface Name**: `wg0`
   - **Description**: `WireGuard VPN`
5. Click **Save**

6. Configure interface settings:
   - Navigate to: **Interfaces → [wg0]** (or the interface name you created, e.g., `hobbiton`)
   - **Basic configuration**:
     - **Enable**: ✅ Check this
     - **Lock**: ✅ Check this (prevents accidental removal)
     - **Identifier**: `opt3` (or auto-assigned - this is fine, shows as interface identifier)
     - **Device**: `wg0` (should match your WireGuard instance name)
     - **Description**: `WireGuard VPN` (optional but helpful for identification)
   - **Generic configuration**:
     - **Block private networks**: ❌ Uncheck (VPN needs to access private networks like 192.168.1.0/24)
     - **Block bogon networks**: ❌ Uncheck (VPN clients may need internet access)
   - **IPv4 Configuration Type**: `None` (leave as None)
     - **Important**: In OPNsense 25.x, WireGuard tunnel interfaces get their IP from the instance's Tunnel Address (set in Task 2.2)
     - You cannot assign an IP configuration type to a tunnel interface - it's managed by the WireGuard instance
     - The IP `10.10.0.1/24` is already configured in the WireGuard instance (Task 2.2) via Tunnel Address
   - **IPv6 Configuration Type**: Leave as `None` (unless you need IPv6)
   - **MAC address**: Leave as default/auto (tunnel interfaces don't need MAC addresses)
   - **Promiscuous mode**: Leave unchecked (not needed for WireGuard)
   - **MTU**: Leave default (or set to `1420` for WireGuard optimization - optional)
   - **MSS**: Leave default
   - **Dynamic gateway policy**: Leave unchecked (WireGuard doesn't need gateway)
   - Click **Save**
   - Click **Apply Changes**

**Note**: When IPv4 Configuration Type is `None`, you won't see IPv4-specific fields (like IP address, subnet mask, gateway). This is correct - the IP comes from the WireGuard instance's Tunnel Address configuration.

**Test**:
```bash
# Check interface exists
# Navigate to: Interfaces → Assignments
# Should see wg0 interface listed
```

**Expected Result**: WireGuard interface `wg0` is created with IP `10.10.0.1/24`.
