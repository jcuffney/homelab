# Task 2.1: Verify WireGuard is Available

**Objective**: Verify WireGuard is available in OPNsense (built-in feature in OPNsense 25.x+, no plugin installation needed).

**Note**: WireGuard is built-in to OPNsense 25.x+ and doesn't require a plugin installation.

**Steps**:
1. Access OPNsense Web UI: `https://192.168.1.1` (or `https://shire.cuffney.com`)
2. Navigate to: **VPN → WireGuard**
3. Verify WireGuard menu options are available:
   - **General Settings**
   - **Local** (for client configurations)
   - **Endpoints**
   - **Status**

**Test**:
```bash
# Verify WireGuard is available
# Navigate to: VPN → WireGuard
# Should see WireGuard menu options (General Settings, Local, Endpoints, Status)
```

**Expected Result**: WireGuard is available in OPNsense (either built-in or via plugin) and menu appears under **VPN → WireGuard**.
