# Task 2.12: Verify Services NOT Accessible Without VPN

**Objective**: Confirm services are NOT accessible from public internet.

**Steps**:
1. Disconnect from VPN
2. Use mobile data (or different network) to test

**Test**:
```bash
# From device NOT connected to VPN (using mobile data):

# These should ALL fail (timeout or connection refused):
curl http://shire.cuffney.com:32400      # Plex - should fail
curl https://shire.cuffney.com:443      # HTTPS - should fail
curl http://numenor.cuffney.com:8006      # Proxmox - should fail
ssh jcuffney@numenor.cuffney.com         # SSH - should fail (connection refused)

# DNS should resolve (Route 53), but services should be blocked:
nslookup shire.cuffney.com               # Should resolve to public IP
nslookup numenor.cuffney.com             # Should resolve to public IP

# Only WireGuard should work:
# WireGuard connection to shire.cuffney.com:51820/UDP should connect
```

**Expected Result**: Services are NOT accessible without VPN connection, but DNS resolution works.
