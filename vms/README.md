# VM Definitions

## Overview

Below is a list of some of the VM's I'd like to create in my homelab - it seems many homelabers have dedicated VM's per application - but I'd like to lean into containerization to make it easier to maintain fewer VM's - while being able to bright many applications / environments up and down easily. 

- [ ] ubuntu (base VM template)
- [ ] k3s (VM for k3's control pane / workers)
- [ ] gpubox (VM that get's 100% of the GPU resources)
- [ ] devbox (VM for remote developement)
